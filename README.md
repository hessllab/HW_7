### Goal
The goal of this assignment is to collaborate with a partner using git, to create
a woking script for downloading stream flow data from the USGS. Using git, we were able to divide tasks, work remotely and in the end merge our tasks to 
complete the assignment.


### Problem
The problem of this assignment is to download historic stream gauge data for a 
set of rivers in North Carolina. The stream gauge data is hosted by the USGS and 
can be downloaded [here](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nc/nwis/current/?type=flow).
To solve this problem, a script was developed in R to automatically download
stream gauge data from the specific rivers and to place this data in separate text files. Then an additional script was developed to report the current levels of each  streams and then place this data into a separte text file.

```
02109500	 WACCAMAW RIVER AT FREELAND, NC
02134500	 LUMBER RIVER AT BOARDMAN, NC
02091814	 NEUSE RIVER NEAR FORT BARNWELL, NC 		 
02105769	 CAPE FEAR R AT LOCK #1 NR KELLY, NC
```
### The Script
The description of the script will go here.

### Results
Examples of the text files will go here.


#### Tasks:

Tasks should be divided among the two of you.  All data, scripts, links, and comments should be exchanged over __GitHub__. Avoid email or texting as you want a complete record of changes in your git history.

1)	Use the fork-clone-branch system to create a new branch of this repo on Github.
2)  Invite the other partner to collaborate on the branch.
2)	Create a _README.md_ file that describes the project including a code and results snippets.
3)	Create an __bash__ script that downloads the historical to present (up to date) flow files for each river and saves them as text files.
4)	Create additional code that would report current flow for each river in a (single) separate text file.

#### Submission Guidelines

Once you have merged all branches, make a pull request to the instructor for this homework.
